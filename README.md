This is a system that takes in EEG signals from the OpenBCI Ganglion board via a CSR bluetooth dongle, and converts it to direction signals via a machine learning library.

## Dependencies
1. Linux
2. Python 3.6
3. Anaconda (actual libraries used are numpy and sklearn)
4. XGBoost
5. [OpenBCI Python](https://github.com/OpenBCI/OpenBCI_Python)
